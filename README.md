The **Car Sales Dashboard** is a comprehensive analytical tool developed using **Power BI**, leveraging a detailed sales dataset from a US car dealership for the years 2022 and 2023. This project showcases advanced data analysis techniques and the application of several **DAX formulas** to compute critical **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)** essential for evaluating sales performance. 

The dashboard provides a robust platform for visualising sales trends, identifying top-performing models and uncovering insights into customer preferences. The calculated **KPIs** empower the dealership to make informed, data-driven decisions. 

This project exemplifies proficiency in **Power BI** and **DAX**, demonstrating the ability to transform raw data into actionable insights, ultimately aiding the dealership in optimising its sales strategies and enhancing overall performance.
